## About me:
I am a third year transfer **computer science major** at UCSD, transferring from Palomar Community College in San Marcos. <br>
I have many hobbies, but if I had to name my top three, they would be: <br>
1. Cooking
2. Lifting weights
3. Listening to music (mainly hip hop/r & b, but I dabble in a bit of everything)
## Programming Background:
I feel like I have at least a basic knowledge of (***Hopefully can add to this later***):
+ C++
+ Python
+ Java <br>
### I also feel like I have a solid understanding of git (not a programming language), with my favorite git command being `git commit` because I like the freedom you have to write different messages that get the point of your changes across. <br>
## My Goals for the next year are: 
 - [ ] Get an internship
 - [ ] Travel to Japan and Korea
 - [ ] Get all A's all year
